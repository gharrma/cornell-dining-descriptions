an All You Care to Eat kosher/multicultural dining room on West Campus


Located next to the Center for Jewish Living building on the south edge of west campus, 104West! is Cornell's kosher and multicultural All You Care To Eat dining room.

You don't have to keep kosher to enjoy the menu selections at 104West! â€“ come sample traditional kosher entrees and enjoy mouth-watering ethnic and international options with a kosher flair. A customer favorite is 104West!'s fresh-baked challah on Shabbat.

104West! is certified by the Orthodox Union (OU), and Jewish dietary laws are strictly followed. Along with meeting kosher dining requirements, 104West! also specializes in Halal, Seventh-day Adventist, vegetarian, vegan, and other diets. Chef Jason Haus comes up with creative menu options that appeal to a wide range of our Cornell customers.

For a quick taste of 104West!, try one of our pre-packaged kosher sandwiches or salads, sold in dining locations across campus. We also invite you to stop by our dining station at North Star in Appel Commons for the same great kosher cooking.
