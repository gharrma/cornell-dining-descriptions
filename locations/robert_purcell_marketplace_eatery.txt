an All Your Care To Eat dining room in Robert Purcell Community Center


Located on the third floor of Robert Purcell Community Center on north campus, the Marketplace Eatery is an award-winning All You Care To Eat dining room with a huge variety of menu options.

Chef Kevin Moore, who has been with Cornell Dining for over 25 years, most recently at 104West!, plans creative menus with roots in a variety of international traditions. Food stations include the Mongolian Grill, where guests select ingredients and a favorite sauce for our chefs who grill to order, fresh sushi rolled right before your eyes, hearthstone-baked specialty pizza, and the largest salad bar on campus. Top it all off with a stop at the ice cream bar or our extensive table of mouth-watering desserts.

Don't miss our Fall Harvest Dinner each September, celebrating local foods and our local farming community, and our Mardi Gras celebration with live music and traditional Cajun fare.
