an All Your Care To Eat dining room in Risley Hall


Cornell Dining's best-kept secret, Risley Dining is an All You Care To Eat dining room in Risley Residential College, just north of the Thurston Avenue bridge.

Modeled after the Christchurch Refectory at Oxford University, the dining room maintains the same gothic charm as when it first opened as the all-Ivy 'Risley Great Hall' in 1913. While the dining room's atmosphere may be very 'Harry Potter,' our servery is completely up-to-date with a daily menu of pizza, pasta, hot traditional entrees, a stir fry station, grill and deli, salad bar, breakfast and fruit bar, and one of the best dessert stations around.

Chef Hans Butler works closely with residents to help plan annual unit specials, including the Day of Dead celebration each fall, and 'A Night at Hogwarts' Harry Potter-themed dinner each spring.
