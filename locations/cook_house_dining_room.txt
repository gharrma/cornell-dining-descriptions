an All You Care to Eat dining room in Alice Cook House


Located in Alice Cook House, the Cook House Dining Room is an All You Care To Eat dining room for the House's residents, and for the whole Cornell community.

As the first dining room to open in the West Campus House System, we are proud to have always worked closely with the members of Cook House to tailor our menu offerings to our residents' tastes. Chefs Eileen Hughes and Harold Evans' daily creations include hot entrees, pizza and pasta, grilled offerings, salads, and irresistible desserts.

House dinners: On Wednesday nights from 6:00-7:00 pm, the Cook House Dining Room is reserved for a House Dinner for Cook House residents. Non-resident guests are welcome to join us at all other times.
