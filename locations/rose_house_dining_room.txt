an All You Care to Eat dining room in Flora Rose House


Located in Flora Rose House, the Rose House Dining Room is an All You Care To Eat dining room for the House's residents, and for the whole Cornell community.

The newest dining room on West Campus, Rose House Dining Room features traditional hot entrees, an Asian station, a grill, a deli, and a salad bar. And there's always a large selection of desserts. Sample Chef Daniel Czebiniak's daily menu options â€“ you won't be disappointed!

Be sure to join us for our 'Flora's Diner' dinner each spring, during which the Rose House Dining Room is transformed into a 1950s diner serving burgers, dogs, fries, and shakes.

House dinners: On Wednesday nights from 6:00-7:00 pm, the Rose House Dining Room is reserved for a House Dinner for Rose House residents.  Non-resident guests are invited to join us at all other times.
